Putting a file in your source code is only appropriate if it's a "resource"; that is, some information that doesn't need to be modified at runtime, but isn't convenient to express as Java source code. For example, localized text and images for a UI is a resource, while a user-specified configuration for window sizes and positions is not. If a file is treated as a resource, you can load it with the getResourceAsStream() method of Class.
